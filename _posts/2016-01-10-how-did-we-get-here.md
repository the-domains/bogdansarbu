# How did we get here?

One of the first things I try to do, is to focus on eliminating redundant tasks. Maybe The Grid will make the website design more straight forward and allows met to focus on the real value added aspect ... content and actions.

The only way to grow, is to give yourself space and time to learn new things. Learning new things enables you to look fresh and with a new perspective on your opportunities. 

All leading me to spend on more time in the mountains ...
